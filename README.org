* SHSX (Scheme HTML S-expressions)
A simple and powerful HTML generator for Gerbil Scheme.

** Installation
Add this to your =.gerbil/lib= directory or install directly from source:

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/luciusmagn/shsx
cd shsx
gxpkg install .
#+end_src

** Basic Usage
SHSX uses a simple syntax where HTML elements are represented as S-expressions with colons:

#+begin_src scheme
(import :shsx/lib)

(def example
 (shsx
  (div: class: "container"
       (h1: "Welcome to SHSX")
       (p: "This is an example paragraph."))))

(displayln (render-html example))
#+end_src

This generates:
#+begin_src html
<div class="container">
 <h1>Welcome to SHSX</h1>
 <p>This is an example paragraph.</p>
</div>
#+end_src

** Control Flow
SHSX provides several control flow macros:

*** @if
Conditional rendering:
#+begin_src scheme
(def admin? #t)

(shsx
  (div:
   ,(@if admin?
      (p: "Admin panel")
      (p: "Please log in"))))
#+end_src

*** @when and @unless
One-sided conditions:
#+begin_src scheme
(shsx
  (div:
   ,(@when logged-in?
      (p: "Welcome back!")
      (button: "Logout"))
   ,(@unless admin?
      (p: "Regular user area"))))
#+end_src

*** @begin
Group multiple elements without creating a wrapper:
#+begin_src scheme
(shsx
  (div:
   ,(@begin
     (h1: "Title")
     (p: "First paragraph")
     (p: "Second paragraph"))))
#+end_src

** Self-closing Tags
SHSX automatically handles self-closing tags like =img:=, =br:=, =input:=:

#+begin_src scheme
(shsx
  (div:
   (img: src: "cat.jpg" alt: "A cute cat")
   (br:)
   (input: type: "text" placeholder: "Enter name")))
#+end_src

** Dynamic Content
You can unquote Scheme expressions inside SHSX:

#+begin_src scheme
(def name "Alice")
(def items '("One" "Two" "Three"))

(shsx
  (div:
   (h1: "Hello, " ,name "!")
   (ul: class: ,(if (> (length items) 2) "big-list" "small-list")
     (li: ,(car items))
     (li: ,(cadr items)))))
#+end_src
